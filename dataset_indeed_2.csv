Background

The institutions of the European Union constitute important partners for UNDP’s RBEC (Regional Bureau for Europe and the CIS) across the multiple areas of governance, poverty, employment, climate, digital and financing programmes and counts amongst the most significant of RBEC’s multilateral partners. As other Member States increase their engagement with RBEC, the imperative of similarly scaling the partnership with the EU institutions has increased across the region. The EU is also a crucial partner in crisis management and recovery in which UNDP in the region supports governments and the UN Country Teams, often in cooperation with the EU.

The countries served by the RBEC, with offices in New York and Istanbul and presences in 18 countries and territories, have close and diverse relations with the EU, ranging from enlargement countries: countries in the Western CIS and South Caucasus and countries in Central Asia and a project office in Cyprus.

The RBEC region is composed of Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus (project office), Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo (as per UNSCR 1244), Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, Moldova, North Macedonia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. RBEC and its Country Offices work closely with their counterparts in the EU institutions of DGENEST, FPI, DGECHO, INTPA, DGREGIO, EEAS, the European Parliament and Council. The Special EU Advisor will play a crucial role in advising RBEC internally and communicating and engaging the EU partners externally to further expand the partnership.

Beyond these EU institutions, RBEC has also cultivated operational relationships with leading European financial institutions, including the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), amongst others. These partners play a key role in bringing financing at scale and expanded options to the EU-UNDP partnership. RBEC hosts an International Financial Institution (IFI) advisor in Brussels to liaison with counterparts and render support to RBEC’s country offices.

The Brussels-based EU development ecosystem is also comprised of multiple policy actors and fora, EU MS officials, think tanks and research institutions, with whom RBEC also maintains close relationships to inform debates and dialogues on issues of priority to both RBEC and the EU.

The Special EU Advisor will position RBEC to respond to a rapidly evolving EU partnership landscape shaped by three major dynamics: the EU’s deepening strategic and financial commitment to Ukraine, UNDP’s Ukraine programme is RBEC’s requiring close high-level coordination with major donors/stakeholders in Brussels; the EU’s shift toward Team Europe and Global Gateway approaches to which its partners are adapting; and the central importance of RBEC’s 10 EU accession countries, where UNDP’s leadership in governance, rule of law and electoral support is critical to helping governments achieve key political and institutional milestones over the next five years.

The role of the Special EU Advisor is based in Brussels, and he/she will be a member of the RBEC Senior Management Team (SMT) chaired by the Assistant Secretary-General and Director of RBEC. A close working relationship will be established with the RBEC Strategic Partnerships and Communications Team (SPC) based in Brussels, New York and Istanbul, to ensure a close connection with new and ongoing EU partnerships at the country office level which the SPC team supports. As this position is based in Brussels and will also work and collaborate closely with the staff representing UNDP’s corporate interests as managed by the Bureau for External Relations and Advocacy (BERA).

Therefore, UNDP personnel are expected to work across units, functions, teams, and projects in multidisciplinary teams in order to enhance and enable horizontal collaboration.

"Jan de Nul Group",,,,,,,,"Your Work Context

For this position good knowledge of the Dutch language is a prerequisite.

As a Site Manager at Jan De Nul, you will be at in charge of ambitious and imaginative construction projects: from Oosterweel to the first offshore energy island to the opening of the Ring in Zaventem. You are in charge of operational management at your site.

Your Role

A job at the crossroads of engineering, coordination and communication. As an early riser, you like to be one of the first on site. With a strong coffee in your hand, you go over the daily schedule, and then you are ready to make sure the site day runs smoothly.The site manager is the central contact point on the site: you are in contact with workers, foremen, architects, suppliers... You keep all the balls in the air and know where the site's priorities lie. You usually do this from the site itself, of course. We therefore aim for your workplace to be no more than an hour's drive from where you live.

Your tasks

You communicate regularly with the project manager and external parties (architects, suppliers, etc.).
You ensure compliance with quality, safety and environmental regulations.
You manage budgets for the purchase of materials.
You draw up schedules and progress reports.
You lead the site meetings.

You do not do this alone, of course. You can count on the support of (experienced) colleagues around you. You learn “on the job”, and the project leader and Buildings Manager are there to answer your questions.

Your profile

A bachelor's or master's degree in civil engineering construction, civil engineer-architect or industrial engineer construction.
The technical knowledge to talk smoothly with workers and foremen and give them clear instructions.
The mindset of a communicative and coordinating go-getter who keeps everyone involved informed and motivated.
Flexibility and eagerness to learn so that you can switch smoothly between the different dimensions of your job.

"Goodtime International Entertainment",,,,,,,,"Seasonal Position in Greece

Cooking in a holiday resort in Greece is not the same as cooking at home. It’s faster. It’s structured. It’s teamwork under pressure.

When guests walk into the restaurant, they don’t see the organisation behind the scenes. They see presentation. They see timing. They expect consistency. That consistency starts in the kitchen.

This is a seasonal leadership role in Greece. You relocate for the season — but without the usual relocation stress. Your accommodation is organised before arrival. Meals are included. Your contract and insurance are prepared. You live and work directly in the resort in Greece.

Your responsibility goes beyond preparing dishes. You coordinate kitchen processes, support food production, maintain hygiene standards and ensure service runs smoothly. You stay calm during peak hours. You understand timing. You guide less experienced kitchen staff when needed.

This is not a relaxed hobby kitchen. It is structured hospitality work with clear standards and responsibility.
That said — you will spend your season in Greece, working in an international environment, finishing service while the sun sets over the resort. The atmosphere is different from a typical city kitchen.

You will work 5–6 days per week. You will live on-site. You will represent the culinary standards of the hotel.

If you are experienced, organised and ready to relocate for a structured seasonal role in Greece, this could be your next professional step.

Apply and become part of the kitchen leadership team in Greece.

Requirements

Professional kitchen experience is essential. You should be confident working independently and within a structured team. You understand food safety regulations and can handle the pace of buffet or à la carte service. English is required to communicate within the international team.

Benefits

In return, you avoid housing costs and daily expenses. Accommodation and meals are included. Your employment is legal and insured. Many chefs use the season to gain international experience while maintaining financial stability during their time in Greece.","<div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Seasonal Position in Greece</b></h3><p></p><p>

"Mollie",,,,,,,,"Build with us

Businesses deserve better from finance. Less friction, more freedom. Since 2004, Mollie has been on a mission to make payments and money management effortless for every business in Europe.

Today, more than 250,000 companies trust our all-in-one platform to get paid, manage money and grow on their terms. Simple, scalable and built with real businesses in mind.

We're one of Europe's fastest-growing fintechs, with 900+ Mollies across 12+ locations. Our people make this growth possible. We move fast, build with purpose and care deeply about our customers. Whether you're solving problems, building market-leading products or exploring how AI can make work smarter, you'll have the freedom to create and the trust to deliver.

If you're ready to grow, shape the future of fintech and join an ambitious, high-performing team, this is the place for you.

Your impact

Our SaaS partners are critical to Mollie's growth, and this role puts you right at the heart of it. You'll own a portfolio of 30-40 strategic accounts—diverse businesses across food, theme parks, parking, ticketing and more—and your job is simple: help them grow, and grow with them.

This isn't about ticking boxes or managing contracts. It's about building real relationships, understanding what makes each partner tick and finding ways to expand what they do with Mollie. You'll work closely with Solution Engineers to improve integrations, drive adoption of products like Mollie Capital and in-person payments, and ultimately increase the revenue these accounts generate.

You're joining a team of 8 Partner Managers in one of Mollie's fastest-growing areas. It's a dynamic role where you'll shape strategy for SaaS partnerships, not just execute it. If you're someone who gets energized by growth, loves solving problems and wants to make a tangible impact, this is your chance.

What you'll ship

Drive new net revenue from your portfolio by identifying upsell and cross-sell opportunities across Mollie's product suite

Reduce churn by building strong relationships, understanding partner needs and proactively solving issues before they escalate

Increase product adoption - get partners using more of what Mollie offers, from Mollie Capital to in-person payment solutions

Expand account footprints by working with Solution Engineers to improve integrations and unlock new use cases

Own your accounts end-to-end - from strategy and relationship building to negotiating contracts and closing deals

Shape the future of SaaS partnerships at Mollie by contributing insights and ideas that influence how we grow this channel

What you'll bring

3-5 years in Partner Management, Account Management or Customer Success—you know how to manage relationships and drive growth

Business development skills—you're comfortable spotting opportunities, having commercial conversations and closing deals

Experience working with Product teams—you know how to collaborate cross-functionally, not just pass things over the fence

Strong networking and relationship-building skills—you're the kind of person people want to work with

Proven ability to negotiate contracts and upsell (ideally hitting a 40%+ upsell rate)

Bonus: experience managing SaaS companies or working in a SaaS environment

Becoming a Mollie: What's in it for you?

We believe our success is your success. That’s why on top of a competitive salary, we offer a bonus to ensure we celebrate our achievements together.

But becoming a Mollie is about more than just the money. We've built a culture that invests in your growth, well-being, and genuine work-life balance. It's about the complete experience. Here’s a glimpse of what that looks like:

Time to disconnect: Enjoy generous time off (your birthday included!) and the flexibility to work from abroad so you can truly recharge.

Focus on your wellbeing: With a monthly wellbeing budget, comprehensive health insurance (Alan), and mental health support, we've got your back.

Fuel your growth: Stay curious and develop your skills with our learning programs, mentorship, and masterclasses.

The best setup for success: We’ll get you started with a MacBook Pro, a home office budget, and allowances for your internet, lunch vouchers and a company car.

Grow your way

At Mollie, growth is personal. We believe everyone should have the chance to develop their skills, explore new challenges and shape their career on their own terms.

You'll get regular feedback and performance reviews to support your development, with fair and transparent salary reviews along the way. Many Mollies move into new roles or take on new projects to stretch themselves, and we actively hire from within to help you take the next step.

No matter if you're aiming for promotion, exploring a different career path or building new skills, you'll be supported with the tools, trust and opportunities to grow your way.

Le Conseil d’Administration de la société anonyme de droit public ASEVA (Agence de Stockage Énergétique- Energievoorradenagentschap) est à la recherche d’un nouveau Président.

La durée du mandat de Président est de cinq ans, renouvelable. Le Conseil d’Administration se réunit en moyenne cinq à six fois par an.

Le mandat n'est pas rémunéré.

Qui est ASEVA ?

L’Agence ASEVA, successeur d’APETRA, est régie par la loi du 21 décembre 2023 « relative à la détention de stocks obligatoires de pétrole et de produits pétroliers, à la détention de stocks stratégiques additionnels pour l’approvisionnement énergétique du pays en cas de crise énergétique, à la gestion d’une crise d’approvisionnement pétrolier et à l’organisation d’ASEVA ».

Cette loi contient les exigences auxquelles les stocks stratégiques pétroliers doivent répondre, crée la possibilité pour ASEVA de détenir à l’avenir des stocks énergétiques additionnels et fixe les grands principes de la politique nationale en matière de crise pétrolière. Elle constitue l’ossature juridique d’ASEVA et fixe ses clauses institutionnelles.

Les principales activités d’ASEVA concernent l’acquisition, le stockage et la gestion de stocks stratégiques de pétrole brut et de produits pétroliers et leur mise à disposition en cas de crise, pour permettre à la Belgique de remplir ses obligations internationales en cette matière.

Actuellement, l’Agence gère un total de 3,9 millions de tonnes de pétrole, réparties un peu partout sur le territoire et à l’étranger proche, sous diverses formes : pétrole brut, essence, diesel, gasoil, etc.

L’Agence est financée par une contribution prélevée sur chaque litre de produits pétroliers mis en consommation sur le marché belge, qui est à charge du consommateur. ASEVA dispose d’un budget annuel d’environ 180 millions d’euros.

La loi de 2023 prévoit la possibilité d’élargir le champ d’action d’ASEVA à d’autres vecteurs énergétiques que les produits pétroliers. L’élargissement à d’autres vecteurs énergétiques dépend de plusieurs conditions qu’il appartiendra à ASEVA et aux autres opérateurs compétents de mettre en œuvre.

Rôle d’ASEVA dans la gestion d’une crise d’approvisionnement

En cas de crise d’approvisionnement déclarée comme telle par les autorités compétentes, ASEVA assure la libération des stocks dans le marché. À cette fin, ASEVA prend en compte divers scénarios de crise, et assure leur approche en mettant en place et en maintenant à jour les procédures et les outils appropriés.

ASEVA maintient sa connaissance et sa compréhension du contexte énergétique international et national, développe des analyses et des propositions de stratégie de stockage en conséquence. Le résultat de ces processus se retrouve dans le plan d'entreprise annuel qui fixe les lignes à un horizon roulant de cinq ans.

ASEVA entretient des contacts à tous les niveaux : international, européen et national, dans le cadre de son rôle et de ses tâches. Elle coopère avec de nombreuses institutions : Commission européenne, Agence Internationale de l’Energie, gouvernement fédéral, la Direction générale Energie du Service Public Fédéral Economie, fédérations et agences de stockage européennes.

Rôle futur

ASEVA doit adapter son modèle d'entreprise aux modifications de consommation d’énergie engendrées par la transition énergétique et les développements récents en Ukraine, ceci en vue d’assurer la sécurité d’approvisionnement : moins de combustibles fossiles, plus d’énergie renouvelables, à faible teneur en carbone et vertes, plus de défis en matière d’approvisionnement, plus et d’autres besoins de stockage, une volatilité potentiellement plus grande du marché, etc. Les défis sont nombreux et importants. En consultation avec les autorités et institutions concernées, ASEVA doit contribuer à la définition de la stratégie de stockage des produits énergétiques pétroliers et additionnels qui doivent être stockés, puis devra mettre en œuvre la stratégie adoptée.

Gouvernance et organisation d’APETRA

ASEVA est une société anonyme de droit public sous la tutelle du ministre fédéral de l’Énergie. Un Conseil d’Administration, composé d’un Président, de six membres et d’un commissaire du gouvernement, détermine la politique d’ASEVA et assure la surveillance des activités du directeur général. Un contrat de gestion entre l'Agence et le ministre fédéral de l'Energie est conclu tous les cinq ans.

Le total de bilan d’ASEVA est de 2 milliards 327 millions d’euros, son budget annuel est de 180 millions d'euros. Ceci couvre les coûts de stockage et de transport des stocks stratégiques, les coûts de fonctionnement de l’organisation et les coûts financiers.

Le personnel d'ASEVA comprend un directeur général et 5 collaborateurs.

Des services tels que l'informatique, la comptabilité et la surveillance de la qualité des produits sont sous-traités.

<p>
L&rsquo;Agence ASEVA, successeur d&rsquo;APETRA, est r&eacute;gie par <b>la loi du 21 d&eacute;cembre 2023</b> &laquo; relative &agrave; la d&eacute;tention de stocks obligatoires de p&eacute;trole et de produits p&eacute;troliers, &agrave; la d&eacute;tention de stocks strat&eacute;giques additionnels pour l&rsquo;approvisionnement &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique du pays en cas de crise &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique, &agrave; la gestion d&rsquo;une crise d&rsquo;approvisionnement p&eacute;trolier et &agrave; l&rsquo;organisation d&rsquo;ASEVA &raquo;.
</p><p>Cette loi contient<b> </b>les exigences auxquelles les stocks strat&eacute;giques p&eacute;troliers doivent r&eacute;pondre, cr&eacute;e la possibilit&eacute; pour ASEVA de d&eacute;tenir &agrave; l&rsquo;avenir des stocks &eacute;nerg&eacute;tiques additionnels et fixe les grands principes de la politique nationale en mati&egrave;re de crise p&eacute;troli&egrave;re. Elle constitue l&rsquo;ossature juridique d&rsquo;ASEVA et fixe ses clauses institutionnelles.</p>
<p>
Les principales activit&eacute;s d&rsquo;ASEVA concernent l&rsquo;acquisition, le stockage et la gestion de stocks strat&eacute;giques de p&eacute;trole brut et de produits p&eacute;troliers et leur mise &agrave; disposition en cas de crise, pour permettre &agrave; la Belgique de remplir ses obligations internationales en cette mati&egrave;re.
</p><p>Actuellement, l&rsquo;Agence g&egrave;re un total de 3,9 millions de tonnes de p&eacute;trole, r&eacute;parties un peu partout sur le territoire et &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;tranger proche, sous diverses formes : p&eacute;trole brut, essence, diesel, gasoil, etc.

ASEVA maintient sa connaissance et sa compr&eacute;hension du contexte &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique international et national, d&eacute;veloppe des analyses et des propositions de strat&eacute;gie de stockage en cons&eacute;quence. Le r&eacute;sultat de ces processus se retrouve dans le plan d'entreprise annuel qui fixe les lignes &agrave; un horizon roulant de cinq ans.
</p><p>ASEVA entretient des contacts &agrave; tous les niveaux : international, europ&eacute;en et national, dans le cadre de son r&ocirc;le et de ses t&acirc;ches.

Description of the positionCan’t wait to make an impact on the world? You’re not alone. Join us in driving progress in the working world and beyond.
Your journey with us

At Deloitte in our M&A Transaction Services – Financial SPA Advice Team we solve important M&A problems that stand in the way of value being created, sustained, realized or protected for our clients. Our M&A Transaction Service practice is an exciting, fast-paced environment, as well as a consistently growing business that focuses on M&A deals for our clients.
We provide valuable support, insight and analysis to our clients and other players involved in M&A transactions, with a focus on accounting and financial aspects.

Our Financial Sale & Purchase Agreement (SPA) advisory team provides expert support to clients, lawyers, and deal teams in purchase price discussion and all other financial and accounting aspects of the deal. Our clients come to us to obtain our advice on the key value items in a transaction, including supporting them in their equity price negotiation as well as the accounting and financial elements in the SPA, supporting them once the SPA is signed on topics as completion accounts, leakage reviews, and earn-outs, as well as M&A disputes.

Pre-signing

In the pre-signing phase, our key focus is increasing and protecting deal value for our clients by supporting them with their non-binding offer or letter of intent, all purchase price, financial and accounting related topics in the SPA negotiation process (e.g. purchase price mechanism, enterprise value to equity value bridge, equity ticker calculations, accounting policies, etc.) working alongside our client’s other advisors to ensure no money is left on the table.

Post-signing

We assist our client with the final purchase price determination process, be it via completion accounts support, leakage reviews in a locked box pricing mechanism and/or earn-out calculations. Depending on whether we are supporting the buy-side or the sell-side, we assist in dry-runs to be fully prepared for the completion accounts process, preparing the completion accounts, or take on the review role. In every situation, our focus is to ensure that value is protected and where possible, maximized.

SPA disputes

Lastly, we support our clients in case of M&A disputes related to the SPA, which can be on price discussions related to the completion accounts, discussions on leakage, earn-outs or financial commitments in the SPA. This can be in a supporting role to the Seller, the Buyer, or acting as an independent expert, but always with the goal of arriving at a final solution in their discussions on the purchase price.

Your job responsibilities will include

Trusted advisor: work closely with clients, due diligence teams, investment banks, lawyers and other deal advisors to optimise value and mitigate risk for clients
Support clients throughout the entire M&A lifecycle in their transaction process

Provide analytical support to our clients and their advisor team to assess the value impacts of different treatments of purchase price adjustments and provide arguments to support them in their negotiations

Support successful transaction execution, including drafting and negotiating the key financial aspects of the sale and purchase agreement, in order to ensure the purchase price mechanism is appropriately drafted, due diligence observations and recommendations are included and our client is appropriately protected by the warranties and indemnities

Post-transaction support to clients for the preparation or review of completion accounts, earn out mechanisms, and support on disputes on purchase price adjustments

Working closely together with our international financial SPA team

Coaching, training and supervising team members both on the job and through more formal technical training
Develop, build and manage client relationships and cross teams within Deloitte to continue to deliver and identify business opportunities

Let's talk about you

You hold a Master's university degree in Finance or Economics
Minimal 5 years professional experience (7years for a Senior Manager) in an M&A Transaction Services and/or audit environment (combination of an audit and M&A Transaction Services environment is considered as a plus)
You are passionate about client service and have commercial awareness

Strong knowledge of how financial statements work and an understanding of the relationships across balances and earnings

Interest in understanding businesses and value drivers

Agility to work with and move between numerical analysis and written documents (e.g. reports, contracts)

Strong analytical skills, an ability to grasp complex issues and explain them clearly, particularly to a more senior audience

Excellent interpersonal, verbal and written communication skills

Strong organisational and project management skills

Excellent time management, being able to work with a number of different clients and internal stakeholders
Our ideal candidate speaks English. Dutch and/or French is a plus

Introduction

« Sans nous, faire les courses serait un véritable enfer. »

Bonjour, nous sommes des collaborateurs de chez Lidl, ce magasin où tout le monde fait ses courses au quotidien. Soyons honnêtes, travailler ici n’est pas toujours facile. Cela dit, nous ne changerions de boulot pour rien au monde.

Travailler chez Lidl n’est pas qu’un simple job. Vous pourriez penser le contraire, comme tout le monde. Cela dit, ce sont quand même les collaborateurs eux-mêmes qui vous dévoilent ici la réalité du terrain. Qui de mieux que nous pour vous raconter ce qui vous attend, pas vrai ? Lidl est un endroit où vous bossez dur, certes, mais où vous recevez énormément en retour. Ici, le chiffre d’affaires et les bénéfices ne sont pas les principales préoccupations, ce sont surtout les individus.« Chez Lidl, vous êtes tout sauf un numéro, car tout le monde se connaît et s’entraide. » L’ambiance de travail et l’esprit d’équipe nous motivent chaque jour à aller de l’avant. Ça vaut le coup.

Ta mission

Assistant store manager, vous êtes non seulement le bras droit du store manager, mais aussi celui de toute votre équipe. « Je gère le magasin comme si c’était ma propre affaire. », confie un collègue. Organiser le planning du jour, réassortir les rayons, motiver les troupes… Vous remarquerez très vite qu’aucune journée ne se ressemble.
Contrairement à ce que beaucoup de gens pensent, assurer le bon fonctionnement d’un magasin n’est pas aussi évident qu’il n’y paraît. « Si nous ne faisons pas notre job comme il faut, nos clients le remarquent tout de suite. Sans nous, faire les courses serait un véritable enfer. Voir des clients entrer dans le magasin et ressortir avec le sourire nous procure énormément de satisfaction. »

Ton profil

« Ici, l’égo n’a pas sa place. Nous bossons dur, tous ensemble. »Cela signifie aussi que vous devez être prêt(e) à vous retrousser les manches et faire preuve de persévérance. Donner le meilleur de vous-même pour votre équipe… Voilà en quelques mots votre fonction. Pas mal, hein ?

Notre offre
Un CDI à temps plein 36h/sem, car nous voulons que vous fassiez partie de l’équipe pour un bon bout de temps !
Un salaire mensuel fixe attractif qui en vaut évidemment le coup.
La possibilité d’avoir du temps libre pour vos enfants ou pour vous. Une aubaine pour les nombreux collègues qui aiment être aux petits soins avec leurs proches.
Mais ce n’est pas tout ! En plus de votre salaire brut, vous bénéficiez d’une foule de primes et d’avantages extra-légaux.
Vous avez droit à 20 jours de congés légaux en plus des RTT. Eh oui ! Il n’y a pas que le travail qui compte dans la vie ! Pour couronner le tout, vous bénéficiez de jours de congé d’ancienneté supplémentaires.
Vous recevez notre planning trois semaines à l’avance afin de mieux organiser votre vie privée.
L’occasion de faire la différence auprès d’un détaillant durable. Ça vaut le coup.
La cerise sur le gâteau ? Nous vous proposons de nombreuses formations et la possibilité d’évoluer : Lidl investit dans votre avenir, et ce n’est pas une promesse en l’air ! « Quand j’ai commencé ici, je n’avais jamais imaginé que j’évoluerais vers un poste de responsable, mais Lidl m’en a donné l’occasion. », raconte une collègue.

Nous sommes convaincus que la diversité renforce notre organisation et nous accueillons tout le monde. Indépendamment de l'âge, de l'origine, de l'identité de genre, de l'orientation sexuelle, de la religion ou du handicap. L'égalité des chances et une rémunération équitable sont au cœur de nos préoccupations.","<div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Votre mission

Do you want to combine a business mindset with financials skills? Do you want to work in a highly dynamic M&A environment? Do you want support companies in their goal to create value through M&A? You’re not alone. Join us in the M&A Strategy team.
Your journey with us
Deloitte has been involved in most of the key Mergers & Acquisitions transactions in Belgium in recent years, assisting both private equity and corporate investors in making well-founded investment decisions.

In order to support companies, the M&A Strategy team provides quantitative and qualitative insights on business operations which link directly to transaction financials in multiple areas, from pre- or post- deal optimization opportunities, synergy gains, streamlined business plans with insights on growth potential, to understanding how a business will operate outside of the group after separation.

Our team works side by side with the Transactions Services team in order to help investors make well-informed decisions based on the full financial and operational potential of their target.

As a Manager in M&A Strategy, you - together with your team - will support our clients in their M&A endeavors. You advise medium to large corporations and investors at C-Level with the development and implementation of their growth or value creation strategy. You will make sure that you keep a holistic view on the end goal and cooperate together with the client to define where deal value can be created.

You will work on topics such as: financial and operational due diligence, synergy and business plan reviews ; carve-outs and post-merger integrations ; cost reduction and performance improvement programs.

What will you do:
Although each client and each engagement will be unique, your activities will entail the following:
Steering discussions and interviews with management, and collaborating with industry experts to gain deeper insights to support clients;
Deep-diving on complex financial, operational and market data in order to come to key conclusions which can be presented to the client in a simple way;
Manage a team to make use of data and diagnostics to build (financial) factbooks to facilitate meaningful and fact driven discussions;
Keeping a holistic view on the deliverables and how a story line should be communicated in a visual and straightforward way towards stakeholders;
Managing and coordinating project’s deliverable towards a client;
Proactively build client relationships, spotting business opportunities and engaging with the client with the support of the team;
Building and shaping the M&A Strategy team by developing new service offerings, coaching and recruiting team members and collaborating with (international) service lines leaders.

Let's talk about you
MBA or a Master's degree in business, economics or finance;
Minimum 6 years of experience within financial/strategy consulting, performance improvement/cost reduction or corporate finance management within a consulting company or in the industry;
Experience in M&A strategy design, or working on post-merger integration;
Proven record of team and project management; and aspiration to be part of and proactively develop a growing team aiming for excellence;
Highly developed financial and business as well as commercial skills;
Ability to manage and communicate clearly to multiple stakeholders;

Recruiter
van Oost, Alexandra - avanoost@deloitte.com
Description of the positionCan’t wait to make an impact on the world? You’re not alone. Join us in driving progress in the working world and beyond.

Real estate is at the core of Deloitte’s industry specialties. We meet our clients’ expectations by delivering focused excellence, independence and fully integrated multidisciplinary services.

Our M&A & Finance - Real Estate advisory covers all possible challenges related to the raising of additional funding (debt, (quasi-) capital) for project developers, real estate investors and corporates purchasing a building.
We advise our clients through the following approach: assessment of client’s activities and real estate, modeling of the cashflow and the financial feasibility, defining the funding mix and funding structure, initiating a first market sounding, defining tax & legal structure & governance, drafting the investor- and/or bank memorandum, assistance in debt raising (both with bank- and leasing companies) and in (quasi-) equity go-to-market, supporting legal implementation and drafting fund(ing) documentation.

Your journey with us:

• Based on a thorough understanding of the clients’ business (strategy and historical results), you will propose the most appropriate real estate structuring solution. You will translate the client’s needs into a Deloitte offering describing our approach, timeline, project team, as well as a budget for the services to be delivered. You will play a crucial role throughout the process from the first client contact to contract signing and delivery.
• You will act as an expert in the financial aspects of real estate development, real estate investment and corporate real estate in general
• You will participate in different business development initiatives.
• Your connection with different (financial)-investor communities, and bank- and leasing companies, will be key for the success of this Real Estate advisory role.
• You will connect with our Tax and Legal team to set up an integrated offering related to our “M&A & Finance Real Estate approach”.
• You will coordinate different projects from A – Z by ensuring an end-to-end follow-up with the rest of the team and act as the single point of contact (SPOC) for the client. Both reviewing and execution will be part of the job, next to the coordination role.

Let’s talk about you

• You are passionate about real estate (both development and investment) and his different asset classes with a good market knowledge based on at least 5 years of relevant experience in real estate and its financials, as a banker, a corporate finance advisor, CFO…
• You have insights into fundraising solutions as finance specialist with notions of legal contracting. Insight into fund setup and structuring is a plus.
• Being connected with real estate developers- and investors communities is very valuable.
• You feel comfortable working on and managing multiple projects simultaneously.
• You are willing to go the extra mile for our clients.
• You are a proactive team player.
• You are willing to invest in tax related real estate topics.
• Having a consulting or advisory background with client-impact is a plus.
